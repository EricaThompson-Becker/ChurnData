# To Churn or Not to Churn
### Erica Thompson-Becker 
### CIND 119 - Final Project (Fall 2021)

A phone company wants to know in advance if a customer is going to churn in the future. We will help the company to characterize customer churn by using Naive Bayes classification and a decision tree classification. This is a project was created as a final project for CIND 119 - Introduction to Big Data at Toronto Metropolitan University. 

The data set contains 21 attributes with a binary class attribute for churn having the choices true or false.
